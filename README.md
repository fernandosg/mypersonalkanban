Introduction
This is a project i made just for fun and learn a few novice things about javascript (i forget for lack of practice).
The project was made for one team that i am working for a investigation project of my university.
The objective of this project is to serve for a collaborative team, which is possible to create private boards which the 
member can insert notes about the progress of a task, edit notes and delete.

Â¿How works?
For tests, the backend where the progress can save, are Ruby on Rails.
